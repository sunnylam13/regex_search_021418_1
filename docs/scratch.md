# Scratch File & Log

The idea is similar to the function that is already enabled within Sublime Text.

We're also going to need to create a test case folder of files for experimenting.

To supply test files use path:

	../docs/testTxtFolder

(one dot means within regex_search, two dots means one level out of it into the main folder)

> findall() is probably the single most powerful function in the re module. Above we used re.search() to find the first match for a pattern. findall() finds *all* the matches and returns them as a list of strings, with each string representing one match.

Apparently findall() can do the iteration to read an entire file and find what you seek instead of writing a loop yourself to do it.
