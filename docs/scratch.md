# Scratch File & Log

The idea is similar to the function that is already enabled within Sublime Text.

We're also going to need to create a test case folder of files for experimenting.

To supply test files use path:

	../docs/testTxtFolder

(one dot means within regex_search, two dots means one level out of it into the main folder)
